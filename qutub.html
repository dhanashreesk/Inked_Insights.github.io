Qutub Minar is a towering minaret located in Delhi, India. It is considered to be one of the finest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture in India and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The minaret stands at a height of 72.5 meters (237.8 feet) and has a base diameter of 14.3 meters (47 feet), tapering to a diameter of 2.7 meters (9 feet) at the top.

The construction of the Qutub Minar was started in 1192 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, and was completed by his successor Iltutmish. The minaret is made of red sandstone and marble and features five distinct storeys, each with a projecting balcony. The balconies are adorned with intricate carvings and inscriptions from the Quran.

The Qutub Minar is surrounded by several other historic monuments and structures, including the Iron Pillar of Delhi, the Alai Darwaza, and the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, all of which were built during the same time period as the minaret.

Over the years, the Qutub Minar has been damaged by earthquakes and lightning strikes, but has been restored and preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Delhi and attracts visitors from all over the world.
